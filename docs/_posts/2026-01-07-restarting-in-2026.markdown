title: "How I Rebuilt My GitHub Pages Blog After 3 Months Away (Without Breaking Anything)"

Three months ago, I set up a GitHub Actions workflow to publish blog posts to GitHub Pages.

Then I walked away.

When I came back, I remembered **none of the details**—only that *it worked* and that I was slightly afraid to touch anything.

This post documents how I reverse-engineered my own setup, confirmed everything was still healthy, and published a new Markdown blog post without breaking the pipeline.

If future you is reading this: you’re welcome. :)

## The Problem: “I Know I Did This Before… But How?”

I didn’t remember:
- How the site was deployed
- What triggered the build
- Where blog posts were supposed to live
- Whether I used Jekyll, Pages, or some custom magic

What I *did* know:
- The site was live
- I had pushed posts before
- GitHub Actions was involved

So instead of guessing, I treated this like a troubleshooting exercise.

---

## Step 1: Find the Source of Truth (The Repo)

First, I identified the repository that actually powers the site.

This was either:
- `username.github.io`, or
- A repo with **GitHub Pages enabled** under `Settings → Pages`

Once I found it, I stopped worrying about memory and started trusting the repo history.

---

## Step 2: Confirm How GitHub Pages Is Deploying

In `Settings → Pages`, I checked the **Source**.

Seeing **“GitHub Actions”** immediately answered a big question:
> *Okay, I didn’t manually deploy this. A workflow does it for me.*

That meant:
- I don’t need to run commands locally
- A `git push` is all it takes
- If something breaks, the answer will be in Actions logs

---
## Step 3: Inspect the GitHub Actions Workflow

Next stop: the **Actions** tab.

I opened the most recent workflow run and then the actual workflow file under:
.github/workflows/

Key things I verified:
- The workflow triggers on pushes to `main`
- It builds the site
- It deploys to GitHub Pages

At this point, I knew:
> If I commit the right files to the right place, the rest is automatic.

---

## Step 4: Confirm This Is a Jekyll Blog

To avoid posting content in the wrong format, I checked the repo structure.

Seeing these files made it clear:
- `_posts/`
- `_config.yml`
- `Gemfile`

This is a **Jekyll-powered GitHub Pages blog**.

That answered another critical question:
> Blog posts must go in `_posts/` and follow Jekyll conventions.

---

## Step 5: Reverse-Engineer a Past Post

Instead of guessing the format, I opened an existing blog post.

Things I noted immediately:
- Filename pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- YAML front matter at the top
- Layout name (`post`)
- Date format

That old post became my template.

This is a highly underrated move: **let your past work tell you what’s required.**

## Step 6: Create the New Markdown Post

With confidence restored, I created a new file:
From there, it was just writing Markdown.
No tooling. No local preview. No overthinking.
