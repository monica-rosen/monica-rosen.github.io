title: "Why I'm Learning to Code with Claude (To Become an AI Architect)"

## The "No-Code" Lie

For the last few years, especially when I was teaching developing courses in AWS, this narrative has been seductive: *"You don't need to learn to code. AI will do it for you."*

In my role leading Product Enablement at a $2.6B cybersecurity firm, I lived comfortably in that "No-Code" world. I built complex systems using drag-and-drop tools, LMS platforms, and logic. I was the bridge between Product and Sales—the human connective tissue that made sure the technology actually got used.

But as I look toward the next era of work—specifically the rise of the **[Billion-Dollar Company of One](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markminevich/2025/08/20/the-billion-dollar-company-of-one-is-coming-faster-than-you-think/)**—I’ve realized something critical.

**AI can write the code. But it needs an Architect to design the blueprint.**

That is why, this month, I am doing something that seems counter-intuitive for a strategic enablement leader: **I am learning to code with Claude.**

### From Enablement Lead to AI Enabling Architect

I am not trying to become a full-stack developer. I have no interest in debating the merits of React vs. Vue or memorizing syntax for 8 hours a day. 

My goal is **Code Literacy**, not Code Fluency.

In 2026, the bottleneck for non-technical founders isn't "having an idea." It's the friction of execution. They have 20 different AI subscriptions—Relevance AI for agents, Clay for data, Slack for communication—but those tools don't talk to each other. They are "over-tooled and under-enabled."

I am learning to code so I can build the **Connective Tissue** between those tools.


### Why Claude Code? (The "Centaur" Advantage)

I just picked up a subscription to **Claude Code**, Anthropic's advanced coding agent. Why? Because it changes the learning curve entirely.

* **Old Way:** Learn syntax $\rightarrow$ Write Code $\rightarrow$ Debug Errors $\rightarrow$ Build Logic.
* **The Centaur Way:** Define Logic $\rightarrow$ Architect System $\rightarrow$ **Claude Writes Code** $\rightarrow$ I Review & Deploy.

By taking a focused 5-hour course on video coding alongside Claude, I am skipping the "Syntax Valley of Death." I am learning how to ask the machine to build "Glue Scripts"—simple Python or JSON bridges that automate the boring stuff.

**Example:**
Instead of manually downloading a transcript from a PM demo, summarizing it, and uploading it to an LMS, I can now ask Claude to: *“Write a script that watches this Drive folder, sends new audio to Gemini for synthesis, and pushes the JSON output directly to the Docebo API.”*

That is not "coding." That is **Automated Enablement.**

### The "Unfair Advantage" for Non-Technical Founders

This journey isn't just about me. It’s about the market I’m preparing to serve.

There is a massive wave of non-technical founders entering the arena. They have vision, they have sales skills, and they have grit. But they are terrified of the "Black Box" of engineering.

By becoming an **AI Architect** who speaks their language (Business/Sales) *and* the machine's language (Code/Logic), I can offer them something a standard dev shop cannot:

1.  **Security:** I apply "Cybersecurity-grade" governance to their AI agents (thanks to my background).
2.  **Context:** I ensure the AI understands their GTM strategy (thanks to my Enablement roots).
3.  **Independence:** I build systems they can run themselves, rather than locking them into an expensive engineering retainer.

### The 5-Hour Challenge

I am giving myself a deadline. I am taking a 5-hour "Code with Claude" crash course. My goal is not to build a Facebook clone, but to build **one functioning, autonomous agentic workflow** that solves a real problem in my current day-to-day work.

I’m building the nervous system for the next generation of companies. And I’m starting with my own.

*Are you a non-technical founder drowning in tools but starving for a system? Let’s connect. I’m building the connective tissue you’ve been looking for.*
