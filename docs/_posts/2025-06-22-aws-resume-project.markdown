title: "Why I Write Blogs in Markdown on GitHub (Instead of Substack or LinkedIn)"

People often ask why I write my blog posts in **Markdown on GitHub** instead of using Substack, LinkedIn, or a polished website builder.

The short answer:  
I’m optimizing for **hands-on fluency**, not reach.

The longer answer is about fundamentals, automation, and staying close to the tools that actually shape how technology gets built.

## The Temptation of Platforms

Substack, LinkedIn, Medium, and no-code site builders are excellent tools.

They offer:
- Distribution
- Analytics
- Templates
- Zero setup

If your primary goal is audience growth, they’re often the right choice.

But they abstract away something I care deeply about:
> How systems actually work.

## Markdown + GitHub Is the Smallest Honest Unit

Writing in Markdown on GitHub forces me to interact with:
- File systems
- Naming conventions
- Version control
- CI/CD workflows
- Deployment automation

There’s no “Publish” button.

There’s only:
edit → commit → push → observe


That loop mirrors real engineering work far better than any platform UI.

---

## Getting My Hands Dirty Is the Point

As a technologist, I don’t want my writing environment to be *frictionless*.
I want it to be **representative**.

Every post touches:
- Git fundamentals
- Automation pipelines
- Configuration files
- Build logs

These are the same surfaces where real systems fail—or succeed.

Choosing GitHub keeps my muscle memory honest.

## Back to Basics Is a Strategic Choice

There’s a quiet cost to living only in polished tools:
you lose your sense of the underlying machinery.

Markdown on GitHub is:
- Portable
- Vendor-neutral
- Diffable
- Automatable
- Future-proof

If GitHub disappeared tomorrow, I’d still have:
- Plain text files
- Full history
- A deployable static site

That resilience matters more to me than convenience.

## AI and Automation Change the Equation

As AI becomes more capable, the people who benefit most won’t be the ones clicking buttons.

They’ll be the ones who understand:
- Inputs and outputs
- Source control
- Pipelines
- Deterministic workflows

Markdown + GitHub is an ideal substrate for AI:
- Easy for models to read and generate
- Easy to validate with diffs
- Easy to automate end-to-end

This blog is already “AI-ready” without special tooling.

## Writing Where Automation Lives

When I write on GitHub:
- My content lives next to code
- Automation is a first-class citizen
- Publishing is reproducible

That means I can:
- Auto-generate drafts
- Validate structure
- Trigger workflows
- Refactor content like software

None of that fits naturally inside a walled platform.

---

## This Isn’t Anti-Platform. It’s Pro-Fundamentals.

I still use LinkedIn.
I still read Substack.

But my **source of truth** lives in Markdown.

Platforms can amplify.
GitHub helps me think.

And in a world moving faster every year, thinking clearly about systems is a competitive advantage.

## Why This Matters for Technologists

If you work in:
- Engineering
- DevOps
- Security
- Enablement
- Platform teams

Your writing environment is also your learning environment.

Mine reminds me daily:
> Technology rewards those who stay close to the primitives.

So I write where the primitives live.

On GitHub.
In Markdown.
With automation watching.
