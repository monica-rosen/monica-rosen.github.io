# The Connective Tissue

**The gap between a "Product Feature" and a "Technical Win" is where most startups lose revenue.**

I am an **AI Enablement Architect** building the frameworks that bridge this divide. Drawing on a career scaling global programs at **AWS and IBM**, I help founders and technical teams move beyond "vibe-ware" to ensure their product actually delivers in the field.

### What I Share:
In this space, I document my research, blueprints, and thoughts on:
* **AI & Automation:** Transitioning from "chatbots" to autonomous agents that drive technical outcomes.
* **Tech Enablement:** Bridging the gap between engineering-led product features and field-led revenue.
* **Scalable Learning:** Moving beyond 60-slide decks to high-fidelity, repeatable validation systems.

### Core Pillars:
* **High-Fidelity Validation:** Building battle-tested confidence in "broken," real-world environments.
* **Integrity-First Systems:** Ensuring your technical enablement reflects reality, because **Integrity** is the only currency that matters in 2026.

> **I architect the systems that turn technology into revenue.**
